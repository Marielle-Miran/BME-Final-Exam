LIFESTYLE choices that can increase of getting idiopathic lung fibrosis are smoking, exposure to dust/fume, acid reflux/GERD (tiny amounts of acid that enter the lungs may cause injuries), viral infections (may trigger fibrosis), older age, and being a male (men have a greater risk of getting idiopathic lung fibrosis compared to women)*  \n",

Another one is lifestyle adjustments, such as exercising and smoking cessation. If the progression of the disease is advanced, lung transplant may be an option or a mechanical ventilation.* \n",

    "\n",
    "* Biological mechanisms (anatomy, organ physiology, cell & molecular physiology): *ANATOMY: Mainly, idiopathic lung fibrosis causes damage to the interstitial tissue (the thin layer between the alveoli and capillaries.) Over time, this tissue will thicken in the lower and outer regions of the lung (subpleural and basal). Furthermore, as the disease progresses, the normal lung structure becomes replaced with scar tissue and cystic spaces which create a “honeycomb” look and reduces the overall size and elasticity of the lungs. ORGAN PHYSIOLOGY: With idiopathic lung fibrosis, the scar tissue causes the lungs to become stiff and less elastic, which makes it harder for the lung to expand when breathing. Furthermore, gas exchange becomes inefficient due to oxygen having to cross thickened and scared walls. Overall, this results in low blood oxygen, shortness of breath, and fatigue. If the progression gets worse, this may lead to the lung capacity decreasing and causing respiratory failure. CELL AND MOLECULAR PHYSIOLOGY: At the cellular level, idiopathic lung fibrosis is a result of abnormal wound healing in the alveoli after repeated microscopic injury. The damaged alveolar epithelial cells then release signals, such as TGF-β, PDGF, and IL-13, which activate fibroblasts to produce excess collagen and scar tissue. Furthermore, due to idiopathic lung fibrosis, fibroblasts will keep multiplying while epithelial cells fail to regenerate. This leads to continuous fibrosis. Additionally, genetic factors (i.e. shortened telomeres and mitochondrial dysfunction) can lead to increased oxidative stress and can cause lung cells to be more vulnerable, while abnormal blood vessel growth and immune activation can further worsen the scarring process.* \n",

    "\n",
    "* Describe how the data was collected -- What techniques were used?: *The data was collected through injecting bleomycin, an antibiotic known for being used in chemotherapy that can also cause lung fibrosis, into a mouse’s trachea. After three weeks, the lung of the mouse is harvested and fixed in paraformaldehyde and mounted in gel or wax. Then using a cryotome or a microtome, the lungs are sliced into sections. The sections are then placed onto a glass microscopic slide and is immunostain by adding a fluorescent-labeled antibody that binds to the proteins (desmin smooth muscle alpha actin, and CD-31). Finally, the slices are viewed under a microscope and a digital image is taken. Important things to note is that the desmin signals are converted to black and white (white = fibrotic lesion and black = healthy lung) and there are a total of 78 images collected at various depths.* \n",
    "\n",
    "* What units are the data measured in?: *The data is measured in microns for the depth of the image.*\n",

    "\n",
    "* What were the limitations/assumptions in the data set: *Yes, there are limitations and assumptions in the data set. One major limitation is that the study uses mouse lungs to model fibrosis in humans. Mouse lungs have a horizontal orientation, whereas human lungs have a vertical orientation. This difference alters gravitational, mechanical, and perfusion gradients, which can affect how fibrosis develops and distributes throughout the lung. Therefore, the results from mice may not fully replicate the spatial patterns or progression of fibrosis seen in humans.*\n"

    "We verified our analysis by confirming that each image was successfully loaded, converted to grayscale, and processed using OpenCV’s `cv2.threshold()` function. For each image, we checked that both white and black pixel counts were non-zero and reflected visible differences in fibrosis severity. The white-pixel percentages printed in the terminal matched the values written to the generated `Percent_White_Pixels.csv` file, confirming that the output data was exported correctly.  \n",

Published research shows that fibrotic lesions increase in the lower and outer (subpleural and basal) regions of the lung, while upper regions remain relatively less affected. In our dataset, images taken at deeper depths of the lung showed higher percentages of white pixels—representing more fibrosis—while shallower slices showed lower percentages. This pattern aligns with the expected physiological distribution of fibrosis, supporting that our analysis and interpolation pipeline produced results consistent with established biological evidence.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Conclusions:**  \n",
    "Our image analysis and interpolation pipeline successfully quantified the extent of fibrosis across different lung depths. The results showed a clear pattern: deeper lung sections contained a higher percentage of white pixels, indicating more fibrosis, while shallower sections displayed less scarring. This supports our overarching question by demonstrating that fibrosis severity increases with tissue depth. The interpolation model also proved useful for estimating fibrosis at unmeasured depths, allowing for predictions without analyzing every physical tissue slice. Overall, this analysis shows that computational imaging can provide meaningful biological insight into disease progression.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ethical Implications:**  \n",
    "Although our data came from animal experiments, it is important to acknowledge the ethical responsibilities involved. The induction of fibrosis using bleomycin must follow approved animal welfare and ethical research protocols (such as IACUC standards). On a positive note, developing digital image analysis tools like this can help reduce the need for additional animal testing in future studies."

    "- Incorporate all 78 available images to build a more complete and detailed fibrosis-depth curve.  \n",
    "- Experiment with nonlinear interpolation methods (e.g., quadratic or cubic) to better capture complex changes in fibrosis severity.  \n",
    "- Use adaptive thresholding or machine learning–based segmentation to improve accuracy under varying image conditions.  \n",
    "- Extend the analysis to include additional color or fluorescent channels to study relationships between fibrosis and other biological markers.  \n",
